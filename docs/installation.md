Installation
=========

We **highly** recommend using `virtualenv` to install `localize`.

You must have python 2.7.x or higher. If you 
have `pip`_ already installed on your system you can run the following
command to install `localize`:

```
    $ [sudo] pip install localize 
```

If you do not have pip installed, you can install it from source:  

```
    $ git clone git://github.com/localize/localize-cli.git
    $ cd localize-cli
    $ python setup.py install   
```
